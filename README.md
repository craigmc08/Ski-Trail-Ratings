# Ski-Trail-Ratings

The plan for this program is to create a system to feed the topograpy of a ski trail in, and get a standarized rating out. What a rating means depends on the ski area, and this would provide a way to standardize between areas.

## Current Status

### GPX files

As the program currently stands, it accepts a gpx file and will output a graph of the gpx track where yellow is the steepest point on the trail and purple is the flattest. 

The next steps are to create a more informative visual display of the data, and creating the rating system to classify trails.

### OSM files

It will take an osm file, and output a map of all ski trails. There are still some quirks with the slopes that are calculated, but overall the osm files are now working well.

## What's next?

The next steps are to create a more informative visual display of the data, and creating the rating system to classify trails.
