# Ski-Trail-Ratings

The plan for this program is to create a system to feed the topograpy of a ski trail in, and get a standarized rating out. What a rating means depends on the ski area, and this would provide a way to standardize between areas.

## Current Status

As the program currently stands, it accepts a gpx file and will output a graph of the gpx track where yellow is the steepest point on the trail and purple is the flattest. 

The next steps are to find more data in a way that enable more than one trail to be processed at a time (ideally in the form of a gpx file, but that is unlikely), create a more informative visual display of the data, and creating the rating system to classify trails.
